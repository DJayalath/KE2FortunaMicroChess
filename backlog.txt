-- Difference between ATTACKED and MOVEABLE needed for computing king pin capture masks

-- TODO --
- En passant blocks and captures
- En passant discovered check
- Castling

-- MAYBE --
- Check / Checkmate highlighting?

-- DONE --
- For piece moves, exclude enemy king from being a legal move (BUT SHOULD STILL BE ATTACKED)
