-- URGENT --
-- Difference between ATTACKED and MOVEABLE needed for computing king pin capture masks

-- TODO --
- Castling 
    + deny castling into/through check
    + deny castling while in check
- En passant blocks and captures
- En passant discovered check
- Bitboard caching

-- MAYBE --
- Check / Checkmate highlighting?

-- DONE --
- For piece moves, exclude enemy king from being a legal move (BUT SHOULD STILL BE ATTACKED)
- Double check non-king move exclusion
